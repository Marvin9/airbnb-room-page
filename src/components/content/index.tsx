      details=" am a home owner in Calgary Alberta and i also rent rooms. I use kijiji to get long term renters on an ongoing basis. Being the nearest rental to YYC airport i have been renting mostly to Pilots &Flight crew (Website hidden by Airbnb) include this info to verify that i would be a trouble-free renter because i will behave the way i would wish/prefer my renters would. The most important concern is that the new person to whom i am letting into my home is safe for me and my other renters. Other very important character traits are of honesty, responsibility and respect and to a lesser degree but important hygiene and cleaning up after oneself. And so you will not need to worry about safety or your property. Also as i am new to airbnb and look forward to getting good feedback and using the service on a regular basis. My personality is easy going happy and helpful."
